This is test-server

Please install nodejs in your system.

I followed this guide to generate self signed certificates.
https://matoski.com/article/node-express-generate-ssl/

>node test-server.js 

will start your server.

It is running on 8443 port.
https://localhost:8443

Restuned server is already running. here is the info

url : turn:104.130.198.163:3478
user: jeet
pass: jeet1

I found some thread where they have issue with disabling AEC. I implemented according to specs. But i had no means of testing this.

This example is also compatible with firefox.
